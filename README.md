# Medical-Image-Segmentation-using-Deep-Learning
* Designed and successfully implemented a UNet model from scratch to segment nuclei from images of tissues
* Conducted experiments on the Learning Rate and number of layers to optimize model performance
* Improved model accuracy through Hyperparameter Tuning, resulting in a Dice Coefficient of over 63%
